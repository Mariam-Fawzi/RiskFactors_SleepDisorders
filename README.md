# Sleep Health and Lifestyle Analysis

This project uses a real-world dataset from Kaggle to explore how factors like stress, occupation, and gender relate to sleep duration and sleep disorders.

## 📊 Key Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- Google Colab
- Exploratory Data Techniques

## 🔍 Project Goals
To understand how lifestyle and demographic factors affect sleep health, and to identify which groups may be most at risk for sleep-related issues.

## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle - Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets)

## ✅ Summary of Findings
- Higher stress was linked to shorter sleep, but not necessarily more sleep disorders.
- Teachers and nurses (mostly female roles) had lower stress but higher sleep disorder rates.
- Women reported more sleep disorders despite lower stress, likely influenced by their occupational roles.
- Occupation appears to be a stronger predictor of sleep health than stress or gender alone.

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Uneven number of participants across occupations may affect representativeness.
- Self-reported data may include some bias.

## 📌 Conclusion
Occupation type and job structure were the most influential factors in predicting sleep disorders. These findings support the need for targeted, role-specific wellness interventions.
