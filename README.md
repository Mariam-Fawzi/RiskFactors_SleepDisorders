# Lifestyle and Sleep Health Analysis

This project uses a real-world dataset from Kaggle to explore how factors like stress, occupation, and gender relate to sleep duration and sleep disorders. It aims to provide a deeper understanding of how lifestyle and demographic factors affect sleep health, and to identify which groups may be most at risk for sleep-related issues.

## Key Tools Used
- Python (Pandas)
- Google Colab
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle – Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uom190346a/sleep-health-and-lifestyle-dataset)

## Summary of Findings
- Stress Level and Sleep Duration: On average, participants with higher stress levels reported shorter sleep hours, revealing an expected negative correlation between stress and sleep quality.

- Occupation & Sleep Duration: Occupations such as Sales Representative and Scientist had the lowest average sleep durations (5.9 and 6.0 hrs, respectively), while Engineers and Lawyers had the highest (around 8 hrs). These results suggest how job structure and overall workload may significantly influence sleep.

- Occupation & Stress Level: Stress varied by profession, with Sales Representatives (8/10) and Scientists (7/10) reporting the highest average stress, while Engineers (3.9/10) and Teachers (4.5/10) having the lowest. This pattern, when paired with the sleep duration data, supports a strong link between occupational stress and sleep reduction.

- Occupation & Gender: Male participants were mostly represented in legal, sales, and medical professions (e.g., lawyers, salespeople, and doctors), which were also associated with higher stress levels. Female participants were more commonly found in nursing, teaching, and accounting, which revealed moderate-to-lower stress levels.

- Occupation & Sleep Disorders: Nurses had an exceptionally high count of sleep apnea cases (61), possibly due to irregular shifts and physically demanding schedules. Teachers and Salespeople reported higher cases of insomnia (27 and 29 respectively), highlighting how emotional or cognitive factors may affect sleep quality.

- Gender & Stress Level: Men (6.1/10) reported slightly higher average stress levels than women (4.7) in this dataset; this aligns with their occupational representation, as men were, on average, in professions with higher reported stress levels.

- Gender & Sleep Disorders: Despite lower stress, women experienced more sleep disorders (insomnia or apnea) than men, indicating that factors beyond perceived stress, such as biological, hormonal, or psychological differences, may influence sleep health. This could also be partially explained by occupational placement: a large number of women were represented in the nursing profession, which had the highest number of sleep apnea cases overall.

## Limitations
- There was an uneven number of participants across occupations, potentially affecting representativeness.
- Self-reported data may include some bias about stress.

## Conclusion
- This project analyzed a real-world dataset from Kaggle titled "Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset" to explore how stress, occupation, and gender relate to sleep duration and sleep disorders. While higher stress was generally linked to shorter sleep, sleep disorder rates did not consistently align with stress alone. For example, teachers and nurses—both female-dominated roles—reported relatively low average stress yet had some of the highest rates of insomnia and sleep apnea. Women overall experienced more sleep disorders than men despite reporting lower stress, suggesting that factors like work schedules, job demands, and biological differences may play a larger role than stress level or gender alone. These results highlight clear gender and occupational patterns in sleep health, supporting the need for tailored, role-specific interventions.
